## New Design Elements

### 1. Gradient Header
**Location**: `fragment_feed.xml`

The app bar now features a stunning **green-to-yellow gradient** background that immediately captures attention:
- Removed elevation for a flatter, modern look
- White search bar contrasts beautifully against the gradient
- Creates a fresh, nature-inspired, energetic identity

### 2. Category Icons
**New Icon Files Created**:
- `ic_sports.xml` - Soccer ball icon
- `ic_social.xml` - Group of people icon
- `ic_outdoor.xml` - Mountain/nature icon
- `ic_food.xml` - Fork and knife icon
- `ic_travel.xml` - Airplane icon
- `ic_photography.xml` - Camera icon
- `ic_music.xml` - Musical note icon
- `ic_art.xml` - Palette icon
- `ic_gaming.xml` - Game controller icon
- `ic_fitness.xml` - Dumbbell icon

Each icon uses Material Design guidelines for consistency and clarity.

### 3. Enhanced Filter Chips
**Location**: `fragment_feed.xml`

Filter chips in the feed now feature:
- White text on the gradient background for better visibility
- Category chips include icons for quick visual identification
- Icons are tinted white to match the text
- Improved spacing and padding for better touch targets

### 4. Dynamic Activity Cards
**Location**: `item_activity_card.xml` and `ActivityAdapter.java`

Activity cards have been completely redesigned:

**Visual Improvements**:
- Increased corner radius to `20dp` for a softer, more modern look
- Elevated card elevation to `6dp` for better depth perception

**Dynamic Category Chips**:
- Each category chip displays its unique color
- Category icon appears next to the category name
- White text and icon for consistent readability
- Increased chip height to `32dp` for better prominence

**Implementation**: The `ActivityAdapter.java` now includes a `setCategoryStyleAndIcon()` method that:
- Dynamically assigns the correct color based on category
- Adds the appropriate icon for each category
- Ensures consistent styling across all cards

### 5. Floating Action Button (FAB)
**Location**: `fragment_feed.xml`

The FAB has been updated to use the accent yellow color (`#FBBF24`):
- Stands out beautifully against the green gradient header
- Increased elevation to `6dp`
- Bold text style for better readability
- White icon and text for high contrast

## Implementation Notes

### Category Mapping Logic
The `setCategoryStyleAndIcon()` method in `ActivityAdapter.java` uses a case-insensitive switch statement to map categories to their respective colors and icons. This ensures:
- Consistent styling regardless of category text case
- Easy addition of new categories in the future
- Fallback to primary color for unknown categories
- Type-safe color and drawable resource handling

### Performance Considerations
- All colors are defined in `colors.xml` for easy maintenance
- Drawable resources are vector-based for scalability
- Icon tints are applied programmatically for flexibility
- Card elevation is optimized for smooth scrolling

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Animated Gradient**: Consider adding subtle gradient animations
2. **Dark Mode**: Create a dark theme variant with adjusted colors
3. **Accessibility**: Add high-contrast mode for better accessibility
4. **Customization**: Allow users to choose from preset color themes
5. **Micro-interactions**: Add subtle animations when selecting categories
6. **Lottie Animations**: Replace static icons with animated Lottie files

### Recommended Improvements
1. Add ripple effects to cards for better touch feedback
2. Implement shared element transitions between screens
3. Add loading shimmer effects with brand colors
4. Create custom illustrations for empty states
5. Design custom onboarding screens with the new theme
